"""Temperaments for the minichord: the one place they are defined.

Each temperament is one entry in PROFILES. Running this script writes

  ../include/temperament_profiles.h   the table the firmware reads
  parameters.json                     the temperament parameter's max_value and tooltip

and prints the options and notes for an editor's temperament control.

A temperament's number is stored in presets, so its position in PROFILES must
never change: add new ones at the end only.

Every temperament is defined the way a tuner would describe it and turned into
whole-cent offsets from equal temperament for the twelve pitch classes:

  fifths(...)   twelve fifths round the circle, C-G, G-D, D-A, A-E, E-B, B-F#,
                F#-C#, C#-G#, G#-D#, D#-A#, A#-F, F-C, each given as its deviation
                from a pure 3:2 in cents. Exactly one is None: it takes whatever
                is needed for the circle to close (the wolf, in a meantone).
  ratios(...)   the twelve notes C, C# ... B as frequency ratios to C.
  edo(n)        a division of the octave into n steps instead of twelve. These
                need note tables in main.cpp (the edo_* arrays), so only the
                divisions that already have them are accepted.

Offsets are then shifted so that A has none. A therefore sounds at the master
tuning pitch in every temperament, the way a tuner sets A to the fork and
tempers the rest around it. The tuning is still fixed to the keyboard: which
keys are sweet and which are rough does not follow the key signature.
