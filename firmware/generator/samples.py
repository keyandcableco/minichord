"""Builds the sampled instruments (lib/minichord_samples) from one-note-per-file recordings.

The recordings are the General MIDI instruments rendered one note per file by the
midi-js-soundfonts project (https://github.com/gleitz/midi-js-soundfonts), as the
Minichord Lab keeps them in its samples/ folder: FluidR3_GM (CC BY 3.0) and Musyng Kite
(CC BY-SA 3.0). Run with that folder's path:

    python3 samples.py ~/minichord-lab/samples

It needs ffmpeg and numpy. For each instrument it takes a few notes across its range,
trims the silence before each, mixes it to mono and resamples it, and gives a sustained
one a seamless loop as the Lab does: the end of the loop crossfaded (equal power) with the
audio just before its start, so wrapping round is continuous, and the loop's start
repeated past its end for the player's interpolation. A plucked one plays once, to where
it has died away. Each note is levelled to the same loudness. The result is the Teensy
wavetable player's data (AudioSynthWavetable::instrument_data), each note sounding across
the notes nearest it, with an envelope that just passes the sound on: the minichord's own
envelope shapes it.

A recording is pitched from the note its file is named for, less any offset in TUNING_CENTS:
some of the renderings are off, and every note played from one carries its error, which a pure
third against it (in 31-EDO, or just chords) makes plain.

Flash is the limit: the firmware has about 740 kB besides the presets' storage, so the
loops are shorter than the Lab's (whose are about two seconds), the choir and strings,
with little above 8 kHz, are kept at 16 kHz, and the sizes are printed at the end.

# Recordings that sound away from the note they are named for, in cents, measured on the minichord
# (the recording played at its own note, so at the speed it was recorded) and offline, the two agreeing
# within 5 cents. Offsets under 3 cents are left alone. Measured with the chords' output filter flat:
# its default 500 Hz band-pass reweights an ensemble's harmonics and moves a fit by several cents
# (minichord-bench/pizz_tune.py, 2026-10-09).
# - pizzicato, played once: 100 to 400 ms after the onset, where the ear hears a pluck's pitch, fitted
#   to the harmonics' peaks; the two methods agree within 1 cent there. The pluck itself and the tail
#   stay off by more, as a section's do.
# - choir and string quartet, looped: a loop only makes frequencies at whole multiples of one over its
#   length (2 Hz for 0.5 s: 33 cents at the choir 44's note), so a fit to the strongest peak snaps to one
#   of them, and two such fits agree by snapping alike. These are the energy-weighted mean frequency
#   around each harmonic over a held loop instead, on the minichord, and offline over the stretch the
#   loop repeats (for the choir 76, whose crossfade brings in earlier singing, over the loop as built).
#   The string quartet is within 4 cents throughout, so none (the viola's earlier +3 left it 4 flat).
# - piano: its fundamentals are within a few cents; its overtones run sharp, as a piano's do, so it is
#   pitched by the fundamental and the lowest overtones, not by a fit to all of them.
