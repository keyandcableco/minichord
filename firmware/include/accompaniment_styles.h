// The rhythm mode's accompaniment styles (rhythm style, address 274), as written parts for the
// four chord voices. See ACCOMPANIMENT in main.cpp for how they are played.
//
// Each event is one note: when it falls in the pattern, which chord voice plays it, what note it
// is, and how long, loud and late (in a strum) it is. Time is counted in 24ths of a beat, as MIDI
// clock counts it: a beat is 24, an eighth 12, a sixteenth 6. A pattern repeats every `length`.
//
// The note is a role, worked out from the chord as it is when the note plays, so a part follows
// whatever the player holds, in any key, temperament and division:
//   ACC_V1 to ACC_V4  the chord voices as they are voiced, lowest first, so inversions, spacing and
//                     voice leading shape the figure (an Alberti bass under voice leading moves the
//                     way a pianist's hand does)
//   ACC_ROOT          the chord's root, at or below its lowest voice: the bass register
//   ACC_BASS          the same for the chord's bass note, which a slash chord changes
//   ACC_THIRD ...     the chord's own tones above that root: its third, its fifth (the tone nearest
//                     a perfect fifth, so a diminished chord's flat five), its seventh (the octave
//                     when it has none); and the chord's second, fourth and sixth
//   ACC_FLAT7         a minor seventh above the root whatever the chord, as the blues has it
//   ACC_APPROACH      a step from the next chord's bass, from the side the voice is coming from, to
//                     lead into it (the next chord is the one held: with chord change on the beat or
//                     the bar, the one waiting to come in)
// octave moves any of them by whole octaves. length 0 lets the note ring until the voice plays
// again. roll delays the note by that many strings of a strum (inter-string delay each).
//
// Voice 0 is the bass part and voices 1-3 the chord part (rhythm bass and rhythm chords, 275 and
// 276), and each voice keeps its own instrument (first to fourth note voice, 270-273), so the bass
// can be pizzicato under a choir.
