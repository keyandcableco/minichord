//-->>RYTHM MODE UTILITIES
/* ---- ACCOMPANIMENT -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Rhythm mode plays the chord voices in time. It used to be one thing: sixteen
 * steps, each a set of the chord's seven notes, all the same length and
 * loudness. It still is, as rhythm style 0, and it plays as it always did. The
 * other styles are written parts (accompaniment_styles.h): an Alberti bass, a
 * waltz, a walking bass, a strummed guitar, and so on, each a few bars of notes
 * that know what they are -- the root, the fifth below it, the top of the
 * chord, a step into the next chord -- so they follow whatever chord is held,
 * in any key, with their own lengths, accents and strums.
 *
 * One clock runs it all: the rhythm timer, every millisecond, moving a position
 * counted in 24ths of a beat (MIDI clock's unit) at the tempo, and playing each
 * note whose time it passes. The old timer fired once a step and worked out the
 * next step's length; this one has a time for everything, so a tempo change or
 * a tap moves on smoothly, a shuffle is just where the off eighth (or sixteenth)
 * falls, and following a MIDI clock is keeping the position from running past
 * the clock's latest tick. The timer only plays notes and lets them go; MIDI
 * is queued, as everywhere (see MIDI OUTPUT QUEUE). It is the only timer the
 * rhythm uses: the LED's flash is let go by it too.
 *
 * The chord: acc_snapshot() records the chord as the player has just made it
 * (its voicing, root, bass and tones) whenever it is built; the rhythm plays
 * from its own copy, taken on the next note, the next beat or the next bar
 * (rhythm chord change). A chord pressed a moment after notes fell due -- the
 * player meant it for the beat and was late -- moves those notes to it
 * (acc_catch_late), as it would on an instrument a player strikes.
 *
 * Voice 0 is the bass part and voices 1-3 the chord part; either can play the
 * style, hold the chord as rhythm mode never could (a bass line walking under a
 * sustained pad), or rest. With rhythm follows hands, the parts sound only
 * while a chord is held, the clock running on underneath so they come back in
 * time, or with the bar starting from the press.
