//for each chord, we first have the 4 notes of the chord, then decoration that might be used in specific modes
/* ---- octave divisions -------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Temperaments 10 and 11 divide the octave into 19 and 31 steps instead of
 * twelve, so every table of note numbers has a version per division: chords,
 * scales, the chord scales of the scale-per-chord harp, the root offsets and
 * the button base notes. apply_temperament() copies the live division's set
 * over the working tables, and EDO, sharp_step and transpose_steps carry the
 * arithmetic everywhere a twelve used to be hardcoded. Intervals are the
 * nearest approximation of each just target in the division: in 31 a major
 * third is 10 steps (387 cents, one cent from 5:4) and a fifth 18 (697).

/* ---- temperament ------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Equal temperament divides the octave into twelve identical steps: every key
 * sounds the same and no interval but the octave is quite in tune. Temperaments
 * 1 to 9 move each of the twelve pitch classes by a few cents, the way a
 * keyboard was tuned before equal temperament took over. Temperaments 10 and 11
 * keep none of the twelve notes at all: they divide the octave into 19 and 31
 * equal steps, where the meantone thirds live and the septimal intervals twelve
 * notes cannot spell become playable.
 *
 * The offsets are in temperament_profiles.h, generated by
 * generator/temperaments.py from how each temperament is built (its tempered
 * fifths, its ratios, or its division); the arithmetic is in temperament.h,
 * where generator/temperament_test.cpp can check it on a computer. A has no
 * offset in the twelve-note ones, so A sounds at the master tuning pitch there.
 * The tuning is fixed to the keyboard, so which keys are sweet does not follow
 * the key signature.
 *
 * In the twelve-note temperaments only the sound changes: note numbers, and so
 * MIDI out, are untouched. In 19 and 31 the note numbers themselves are steps
 * of the division, so MIDI out goes through midi_out_note() below, which
 * rescales to the nearest semitone: the recording lands in the right register
 * and is audibly an approximation, rather than silently absurd.

 * has always carried introduction_version, and the editor already reads a
 * firmware version from address 7. Nothing ever wrote it.
 *
 * So: stamp the version into address 7 on save, and on load give any parameter
 * newer than the stored version its factory default instead of the stored 0.
 * Presets written before this change carry 0 there, which reads as "older than
 * everything" and defaults anything introduced after version 0 — which is the
