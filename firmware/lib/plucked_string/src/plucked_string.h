// A plucked string, by the Karplus-Strong method: a burst of noise one period long
// circulates round a delay line as long as the string's period, losing a little
// each time round and more in the highs than the lows, which is how a string rings
// and mellows. The library's own AudioSynthKarplusStrong rounds the period to whole
// samples, so its high notes are out of tune, and can't move it while it rings;
// here the delay is read between samples, so the pitch is exact and can glide
// (the ribbon, vibrato, a retune).
//
// Input 0 moves the pitch, as AudioSynthWaveformModulated's frequency modulation
// input does (frequencyModulation() octaves at full scale); input 1 is passed
// through, so the string can sit after an oscillator and blend() crossfade from it
// (0, the oscillator alone, as if the string weren't there) to the string (1).
