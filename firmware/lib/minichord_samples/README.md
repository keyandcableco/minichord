# minichord_samples

The sampled instruments the harp and chord voices can play (harp voice, 264; chord voice, 265): piano, pizzicato strings, choir and a string quartet, as `AudioSynthWavetable::instrument_data`.

`src/minichord_samples.cpp` is generated; don't edit it. To rebuild it, run `generator/samples.py` with a folder of one-note-per-file recordings laid out as the Minichord Lab's `samples/` is (`piano/`, `quartet/{pizz,cello,viola,violin}/`, `choir/musyng/aah/`, each note named by its MIDI number). It needs ffmpeg and numpy:

    python3 generator/samples.py ~/minichord-lab/samples

It prints each instrument's size. The sample data sits in flash beside the program, and the presets' storage needs 1 MB at the top of flash, so the firmware has to stay below about 0.9 MB in all: at version 36 there were 82 kB to spare.
